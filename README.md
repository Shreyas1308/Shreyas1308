Hi there:wave:,

Hi, I'm Shreyas Choudhary, a passionate self-taught electronics designer entusiast, data analyst cum visualizer, computer vision expert and a freelance hardware engineer from India. My passion for automation lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant technologies. I take great care in the experience and architecture; and yes I do code especially ARM processors and IoT projects and their performance analysis predictions.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
